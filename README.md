# fritzing-parts
My custom  fritzing parts for breadboard, some of then are slightly oversized in  0.9.4.64 version. 

## How can you create your own parts?
 There are plenty tutorials like [this one from sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/make-your-own-fritzing-parts).
 Most of this parts are imported from PDF to SGV in Inkscape. I made a few changes and imported to fritzing. The whole process is very straightforward in general.
