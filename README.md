# fritzing-parts
My custom  fritzing parts for breadboard.

### How can you create your own parts?
 There are plenty of tutorials like [this one from Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/make-your-own-fritzing-parts).
 
 
 Most of these parts are imported from PDF to SGV in Inkscape. I made a few changes and then imported it to fritzing. The whole process is very straightforward in general.
